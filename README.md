# Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python directory! This repository documents my progress as I learn Python, practice core concepts, and build projects to reinforce my understanding.

## About

This space serves as a portfolio of my Python learning curve. Here, you'll find:
- Mini-projects demonstrating various Python concepts
- Practice scripts and code snippets

## Structure

- `/projectName` — Pacific folder for each small to medium-sized projects applying Python concepts
- `concepts.py` — Practice files and code samples for specific topics (e.g., Classes, Multiprocessing, question solving)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
