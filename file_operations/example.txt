The File interface provides information about files and allows JavaScript in a web page to access their content.

File objects are generally retrieved from a FileList object returned as a result of a user selecting files using the <input> element, or from a drag and drop operation's DataTransfer object.

A File object is a specific kind of Blob, and can be used in any context that a Blob can. In particular, the following APIs accept both Blobs and File objects:

FileReader
URL.createObjectURL()
Window.createImageBitmap() and WorkerGlobalScope.createImageBitmap()
the body option to fetch()
XMLHttpRequest.send()
See Using files from web applications for more information and examples.
